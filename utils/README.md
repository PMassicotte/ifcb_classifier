This folder contains some utility scripts for the project.

- Using SQL to extract the data predicted from images files. In that case, the `RUN` generates a `JSON` file with the predictions. The `JSON` file is nested, and I am using DuckDB to extract the data from the `JSON` file and generate a CSV file with the predictions.

- Using R to export the generated `h5` files to `CSV` files. The `h5` files are generated by the `RUN` when making predictions on images directly produced by the `ifcb` with ROI and BINS.
